### Rules
* You will be controlling a spaceship(denoted by '$' character) that can move only in horizontal direction. It can shoot two types of missiles, one faster than the other.
* Aliens(denoted by 'A' character) will spawn at random locations of the gameboard and stay for short time. All you have to do is hit the aliens with your missiles. 
* You score a 10 when you hit an alien with the slower missile(denoted bi 'i' character). The faster missile(denoted by 'l' character) just increases the life span of an alien(i.e. does not earn you any points).

### Instructions to play 
* Run the following command to start the game.   
`sh python3 run.py`  
* Press any key(except 'q') to start the game.
* Press 'q' to quit.
* Use 'a' and 'd' to control the spaceship.
* Use 's' to shoot a missile.
